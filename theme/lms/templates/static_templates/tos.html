<p id="certificates-and-products"><strong>CERTIFICATES AND OTHER PRODUCTS &amp; SERVICES</strong></p>

<p><strong>Generally.</strong></p>

<p>From time to time, FGYT eLearning and the colleges, universities, and other institutions providing courses and programs on the FGYT eLearning Site (collectively, the "Members") may offer services and products for a fee (for example, course and program certificates). For anything that you choose to purchase on the FGYT eLearning Site, you agree to pay all applicable fees when due. As described in the&nbsp;<a href="https://fgyt.org/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>, the processing of your payment information is done by a third-party payment vendor, and you will be routed to a secure payment flow controlled by that vendor to complete the payment transaction. Once your payment transaction is completed, an FGYT eLearning confirmation page will be displayed, and you will receive a confirmation email with your name, order number, and the payment amount. Please retain this email for your records as this information will be required if you seek a refund from FGYT eLearning, as described below.</p>

<p><strong>Certificates.</strong></p>

<p>FGYT eLearning and the Members may offer Verified Certificates of Achievement for courses (a "Verified Certificate") or certificates for programs (for example, a MicroMasters program certificate) for learners who, in the Members&rsquo; judgment, have satisfactorily demonstrated mastery of the course or program material. Certificates will be issued by FGYT eLearning under the name of the underlying Member(s) from where the course or program originated, i.e. HarvardX, MITx, etc. The decision whether a certificate will be awarded to a given learner will be solely within the discretion of the awarding Member.</p>

<p>Subject to the foregoing, you will be required to pay a fee and complete the ID verification process for Verified Certificates. In order to authenticate your identity for a Verified Certificate, you will be prompted to take a webcam photo of yourself, as well as a photo of an acceptable form of photo ID (described below). Although these items are collected by FGYT eLearning in accordance with these TOS and the&nbsp;<a href="https://fgyt.org/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>, you should be aware that the actual authentication of your identity is performed by an FGYT eLearning third-party service provider and this information will be used only for the purpose of verifying your identity. Acceptable forms of photo ID&rsquo;s are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Government or State-issued driver's license</li>
<li>Passport</li>
<li>National ID card</li>
<li>State or Province ID card (including cards issued by motor vehicle agencies)</li>
</ul>
<p>In order to be accepted by FGYT eLearning, your photo ID must:</p>
<ul>
<li>Contain your full name exactly (excluding hyphens, accents, and spaces);</li>
<li>Contain a relatively current photograph of yourself;</li>
<li>Be an original document; photocopied documents cannot be accepted; and</li>
<li>Be current and valid; expired documents cannot be accepted.</li>
</ul>

<p>Unfortunately, if you do not possess a photo ID meeting the criteria described above, FGYT eLearning is unable to provide you with a Verified Certificate at this time.</p>

<p><strong>Refunds.</strong></p>

<p>Certificates and other purchases on the FGYT eLearning Site may be eligible for a refund for a period of time (in each case, the &ldquo;Refund Period&rdquo;). The applicable Refund Period for some products and services are described below.
